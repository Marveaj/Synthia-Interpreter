# Synthia-Interpreter 
Synthia-Interpreter is a custom-built programming language interpreter that features a comprehensive set of functionalities including a lexer, parser, and supports a variety of data types and operations.
For my project, I successfully developed and refined a custom programming language interpreter. This involved creating a robust lexer to tokenize source code, followed by designing a parser for syntactic analysis. I implemented function declarations, enabling the language to support complex operations. The project also included the integration of comments and assignment statements, enhancing the language's usability. I further expanded the language's capabilities by adding a variety of statements and functions which is important to the interpreter's functionality, I enabled the calling of functions within the interpreter itself. Additionally, I introduced a range of other statements and data types, significantly extending the language's versatility. 
This project demonstrates my deep understanding of programming language design and interpreter development, along with my proficiency in implementing complex computer science concepts."
